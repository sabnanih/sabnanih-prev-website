<!--I am interested in the areas of Data Mining, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval. Prior to being a grad student, I was an undergrad at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information Technology (<a href="http://www.daiict.ac.in/daiict/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DA-IICT</a>), Gandhinagar, India. I was born in Gwalior, India but have stayed in many places like Indore, Mumbai, Delhi, Guna, etc. I did most of my schooling from <a href="http://www.mahindraacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mahindra Academy</a>, Mumbai and <a href="http://www.sicaschool.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SICA</a>, Indore. I like watching and reading about sports (particularly cricket), and playing soccer.<br /></div><br />
